Usage
=====

For now there is only one command implemented - SMTP server.

After the installation manage.py help will show you new command, runsmtpserver.

This command runs development SMTP server (which acts as a real one, but not
sends emails) using your EMAIL_HOST and EMAIL_PORT variables - so they should
be set for localhost or any bindable ip/port on your machine.
